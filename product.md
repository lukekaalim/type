# type

## javascript

A _value_ is _linked_ to a _type_ either by _annotation_ or a collection of _inferences_.

Inside a _scope_ an _identifier_ is assigned a _value_ or _type_.

A _type_ is a unique identifier of a value, describing a _state_ that the value is in.

Through _refinement_ of _variants_, a _type_ can be _constrained_ to a more specific _type_.
