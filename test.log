× @lukekaalim/type should provide a safe typing language
  × Parser should parse the sourcecode into an estree
    × Should get a good AST and parse it for errors
  ✓ The Type System should be able to refine abstract values into variants of constraints
    ✓ The variant constraints generated by generateConstraints() cover every permutation
      ✓ There are 5 different states a pet could be (bengal, persian, dog, rabbit, plant)
        ✓ The length of the array of states should be 5
      ✓ If a constraint (Animal === Cat), then we only generate constrains where that bond is true
        ✓ The length of the array of states should be 3
    ✓ The intersectional relationship should cause constrains to be generated for every variant this type intersects
      ✓ There should be four different variants, since phoneNumber is intersecting with two binary variants (2 * 2)
