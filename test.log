× @lukekaalim/type should provide a safe typing language
  × Parser should parse the sourcecode into an estree
    × Use has not yet decided what a test for this value is
  ✓ The Type System should be able to refine abstract values into variants of constraints
    ✓ The variant constraints generated by createRefinementsForTypeId() cover every permutation
      ✓ There are 5 different states a pet could be (bengal, persian, dog, rabbit, plant)
        ✓ The length of the array of states should be 5
      ✓ If a constraint (Animal === Cat), then we only generate constrains where that bond is true
        ✓ The length of the array of states should be 3
    ✓ The intersectional relationship should cause constrains to be generated for every variant this type intersects
      ✓ There should be four different variants, since phoneNumber is intersecting with two binary variants (2 * 2)
  ✓ The Source module should be able to determine facts and locations of source nodes
    ✓ expectLinesFromIndex should find the line of source code from a character index
      ✓ Very first index should be line zero
        ✓ Values (0 === 0) are equal
      ✓ Line with the word second should be line one
        ✓ Values (1 === 1) are equal
      ✓ Very final index should be line two
        ✓ Values (2 === 2) are equal
  ✓ Function should generate a signature with a matching type
